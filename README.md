This fork of Moonlight-Qt will be customized to:

- Modify branding and UI/UX for our client.
- Integrate with our custom authentication layer.
- Add support for in-app announcements, localized game launching, or platform controls.
- Align with our internal MVP and product roadmap.

We respect and thank the Moonlight development team for their open-source work under GPLv3.
